## Resubmission
This is a resubmission of the nomine package which was archived from CRAN in 2018.
The package has been updated to work with current API endpoints:

* Updated NamePrism API calls to use HTTPS (HTTP endpoints no longer work)
* Updated NamSor API integration to v2 with new authentication method
* Updated package maintainer information
* All functionality has been preserved with only necessary breaking changes to API
  authentication parameters

## Test environments
* local macOS install, R 4.3.2
* R CMD check --as-cran

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There were 4 NOTEs:

1. New submission / Package was archived on CRAN
   This is expected as we are resubmitting an archived package with updates.

2. checking for future file timestamps
   Unable to verify current time - this is a system-level note and can be ignored.

3. checking examples
   Examples with CPU time > 5s: get_ethnicities (5.025s elapsed)
   This is expected as the function makes API calls which require network time.

4. checking HTML version of manual
   Standard HTML validation warnings from R's HTML generator (missing "summary"
   attributes, etc.) - these are generated by R's tools and not from our code.

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies for this package.
